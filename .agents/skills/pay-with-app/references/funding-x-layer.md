# Funding USDT0 on X Layer via the Uniswap Trading API

When the wallet lacks the asset required by an APP Pay Per Use 402
challenge, acquire it on X Layer (chain 196) using the Uniswap Trading
API. The API supports both same-chain swaps on X Layer and cross-chain
routing into X Layer (powered by Across).

## Pick the Source Chain and Token

Inspect the user's ERC-20 holdings across supported source chains and
prefer cheapest gas + deepest liquidity to the destination.

```bash
set -euo pipefail

# USDC on Base (cheapest bridge gas)
cast call 0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913 \
  "balanceOf(address)(uint256)" "$WALLET_ADDRESS" \
  --rpc-url https://mainnet.base.org

# USDC on Ethereum
cast call 0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48 \
  "balanceOf(address)(uint256)" "$WALLET_ADDRESS" \
  --rpc-url https://eth.llamarpc.com

# Native ETH on Base / Ethereum (use zero address for the swap input)
cast balance "$WALLET_ADDRESS" --rpc-url https://mainnet.base.org
```

Path priority for landing **USDT0** on X Layer:

1. Source already holds USDT0 on X Layer, skip funding entirely.
2. Source holds USDG on X Layer, same-chain swap USDG to USDT0 (Phase
   A, single hop).
3. Source holds USDT0 on a different chain, Phase B cross-chain
   (likely cheapest).
4. Wallet has a stablecoin (USDC) on Base / Arbitrum / Mainnet,
   cross-chain route to USDT0 on X Layer (Phase B).
5. Wallet has native ETH on Base / Mainnet, cross-chain route from
   native (zero address `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`)
   to USDT0 on X Layer (Phase B handles swap + bridge in one quote).
6. Wallet only holds non-USDT0 tokens on X Layer, same-chain swap
   (Phase A).

## Phase A: Same-Chain Swap on X Layer

Use this when the wallet already holds a token on X Layer (e.g. WOKB or
USDG) and needs to convert it to the asset required by the 402
challenge. Skip if the wallet has no relevant tokens on X Layer.

> **Confirmation gate** before approval and before broadcast.

> **Pre-flight: OKB balance check.** Same-chain X Layer swap requires

>
> ```bash
> set -euo pipefail
> OKB_BAL=$(cast balance "$WALLET_ADDRESS" \
>   --rpc-url "${X_LAYER_RPC_URL:-https://rpc.xlayer.tech}")
> # Non-zero OKB sanity check. This does not guarantee enough gas to broadcast

> [ "$OKB_BAL" != "0" ] || {
>   echo "Same-chain X Layer swap requires OKB for gas. Wallet has 0 OKB. Either acquire OKB first, or route entirely cross-chain (Phase B) which only needs source-chain gas." >&2
>   exit 1

      urgency:          "normal"
    }')") || { echo "Trading API quote failed" >&2; exit 1; }
```

Then `check_approval` (only if `tokenIn` is not native), build the
permit signature when required, and broadcast via `/swap`. Detailed
`check_approval` + permit + `/swap` flow is identical to the
[`pay-with-any-token`](../../pay-with-any-token/references/trading-api-flows.md)
flow. See that reference and substitute the X Layer chain ID and
addresses.

Before broadcasting via `/swap`, gate on quote freshness:

```bash
set -euo pipefail

ELAPSED=$(($(date +%s) - QUOTE_FETCHED_AT))
[ "$ELAPSED" -lt 45 ] || {
  echo "Quote is $ELAPSED seconds old; refetch before broadcasting." >&2
  exit 1
}
```

### Source-chain shortfall preflight (REQUIRED before quoting)

Before calling `/quote` or recommending a bridge, **verify the user's
source-chain wallet actually has enough of `SOURCE_TOKEN` to cover the
required output amount plus fees**. The most common funding failure is
not the route, it is the user's source balance: e.g. user has 5 USDC
on Base but the 402 demands 100 USDT0 on X Layer. Recommending "bridge
100.5 USDC from Base" in that situation is wrong; the user does not
have 100.5 USDC to bridge.

```bash
set -euo pipefail

# X402_AMOUNT is in base units of the X Layer DESTINATION asset (e.g.
# USDT0 6 decimals). For a same-decimal source token (USDC also 6), the
# minimum source amount needed is X402_AMOUNT plus buffer. For a
# different-decimal source token, scale appropriately and consult an
# oracle or quote for an estimate. The check below uses the same-decimal
# stablecoin path (USDC -> USDT0, USDG -> USDT0, etc.). For different
# decimals or non-stable source tokens, fetch a price quote first and
# use the input-amount it returns to gate this check.
SOURCE_REQUIRED_BASE_UNITS=$(python3 -c "print(($X402_AMOUNT * 1005) // 1000)")

SOURCE_BALANCE=$(cast call "$SOURCE_TOKEN_ADDRESS" \
  "balanceOf(address)(uint256)" "$WALLET_ADDRESS" \
  --rpc-url "$SOURCE_CHAIN_RPC_URL")

# Strip cast's "(uint256)" suffix if present and compare via python (uint256-safe).
SOURCE_BALANCE_RAW=$(echo "$SOURCE_BALANCE" | awk '{print $1}')
if ! python3 -c "import sys; sys.exit(0 if int('$SOURCE_BALANCE_RAW') >= int('$SOURCE_REQUIRED_BASE_UNITS') else 1)"; then
  echo "ERROR: source-chain shortfall on $SOURCE_CHAIN_NAME." >&2
  echo "  needed (base units): $SOURCE_REQUIRED_BASE_UNITS" >&2
  echo "  have   (base units): $SOURCE_BALANCE_RAW"          >&2
  echo "Cannot fund the 402 from this source. Ask the user for an"  >&2
  echo "alternative source chain, a smaller payment amount, or to"  >&2
  echo "top up the source wallet first." >&2
  exit 1
fi
```

Refusing here is the correct behavior: a bridge instruction the user
cannot execute is worse than no instruction. If multiple source chains
are available and one has the funds, suggest that one. If none do,
surface the shortfall in plain language and stop, do not auto-pivot
into a different funding plan without re-confirming with the user via
`AskUserQuestion`.

### Quote and bridge

The block below describes the design intent: a single Trading API quote
that handles swap + bridge into X Layer. It is preserved so the skill
works without code changes the day Across adds X Layer. Today, expect
the quote call to return `ResourceNotFound`. When that happens, fall
through to the user-handoff path documented at the end of this section.

Apply a **0.5% buffer** to compute `X402_AMOUNT_WITH_BUFFER` from
`X402_AMOUNT` to absorb bridge fees. If the shortfall is < $5 worth,
top up to $5 to amortize source chain gas.

```bash
set -euo pipefail

# Apply 0.5% buffer (uint256-safe integer math via python)
X402_AMOUNT_WITH_BUFFER=$(python3 -c "print(($X402_AMOUNT * 1005) // 1000)")
[[ "$X402_AMOUNT_WITH_BUFFER" =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]] || { echo "buffer math failed" >&2; exit 1; }

QUOTE_FETCHED_AT=$(date +%s)

# Capture HTTP status and body separately so we can distinguish:
#   (a) HTTP 200 success      -> proceed with the original Phase B flow
#   (b) errorCode=ResourceNotFound (Across coverage gap) -> deferred-bridge handoff
#   (c) network errors / 5xx  -> surface as transient, advise retry
#
# IMPORTANT: do NOT use `curl -f` here. Under `set -e` a non-zero curl
# exit would terminate the script before we read $? into QUOTE_HTTP_STATUS,
# making the deferred-bridge branch unreachable on the exact failure
# path it is designed to handle. We capture status with `-w` instead.
QUOTE_BODY_FILE=$(mktemp)
trap 'rm -f "$QUOTE_BODY_FILE"' EXIT

QUOTE_HTTP_STATUS=$(curl -sS -X POST https://trade-api.gateway.uniswap.org/v1/quote \

    }')") || {
  # curl itself failed (DNS, TLS, network unreachable, etc.) -> case (c)
  echo "ERROR: Trading API call failed at the network layer (curl exit \$? = $?)." >&2
  echo "This is most likely a transient connectivity issue (DNS, TLS, network)." >&2
  echo "Advise the user to retry; do NOT route them to an external bridge for this case." >&2
  exit 1
}

QUOTE=$(cat "$QUOTE_BODY_FILE")
QUOTE_ERROR_CODE=$(echo "$QUOTE" | jq -r '.errorCode // empty' 2>/dev/null || echo "")
```

Branch on the result:

```bash
set -euo pipefail

if [ "$QUOTE_HTTP_STATUS" = "200" ] && [ -z "$QUOTE_ERROR_CODE" ]; then
  : # success -> continue with permitData + /swap on the source chain
elif [ "$QUOTE_ERROR_CODE" = "ResourceNotFound" ]; then
  : # case (b): the deferred-bridge handoff below
elif [ "$QUOTE_HTTP_STATUS" -ge 500 ] 2>/dev/null; then
  echo "ERROR: Trading API returned HTTP $QUOTE_HTTP_STATUS (server error)." >&2
  echo "This is most likely transient. Advise the user to retry shortly." >&2
  exit 1
else
  echo "ERROR: Trading API returned HTTP $QUOTE_HTTP_STATUS, errorCode=$QUOTE_ERROR_CODE." >&2
  echo "Body: $QUOTE" >&2
  echo "Surface raw body to the user; do not route to an external bridge automatically." >&2
  exit 1
fi
```

If `errorCode` is `ResourceNotFound`, **the Trading API cannot currently
deliver to X Layer cross-chain.** This is the expected state today
(Across does not list X Layer as a destination). Surface a clear
message to the user via `AskUserQuestion`:

> "The Uniswap Trading API does not currently support X Layer as a
> cross-chain destination via Across Protocol (verified
> 2026-04-27). To pay this APP merchant, please bridge USDT0 (or
> another stablecoin that lands as USDT0 on X Layer) to your wallet
> using a bridge service that supports X Layer destinations. Once
> the funds arrive on X Layer, re-invoke this skill and we will
> handle the same-chain swap (if needed) and the 402 settlement."

Do NOT recommend a specific bridge product to the user in this skill
version; the v1.0.0 stance is "any bridge that supports X Layer is
fine; pick what you trust." A future skill version may add a
co-marketing-aligned bridge recommendation once verified.

If the quote call DOES succeed (i.e. Across has shipped X Layer
support since this doc was written), continue with the original flow:
quote response contains `permitData` (sign with EIP-712), the `/swap`
endpoint returns the calldata to broadcast on the source chain, and
Across handles the X Layer arrival.

Before broadcasting via `/swap`, gate on quote freshness:

```bash
set -euo pipefail

ELAPSED=$(($(date +%s) - QUOTE_FETCHED_AT))
[ "$ELAPSED" -lt 45 ] || {
  echo "Quote is $ELAPSED seconds old; refetch before broadcasting." >&2
  exit 1
}
```

When you broadcast the source-chain transaction, capture the resulting
hash into `SOURCE_TX_HASH` (used in the bridge timeout message below):

```bash
SOURCE_TX_HASH=$(echo "$SWAP_RESPONSE" | jq -r '.transactionHash // empty')
[[ "$SOURCE_TX_HASH" =~ ^0x[a-fA-F0-9]{64}$ ]] || {
  echo "no tx hash from /swap response" >&2
  exit 1
}
```

> **Bridge recipient.** The Trading API delivers funds to the same
> `swapper` address on chain 196. If the user wants the funds at a
> different X Layer address (e.g. an OKX Agentic Wallet they custody
> separately), an extra transfer transaction on X Layer is required
> after the bridge confirms.
>
> **Quotes expire in ~60 seconds.** Re-fetch if any delay before
> broadcast (the freshness gate above enforces a 45s ceiling).
>
> **Retry hygiene.** On any retry of the quote-then-broadcast cycle,
> re-derive both `QUOTE_FETCHED_AT` (the freshness timestamp) and
> `X402_AMOUNT_WITH_BUFFER` (the buffered output amount) from the new
> quote. Reusing stale values from an earlier attempt will either trip
> the freshness gate or quote against an outdated buffer.

## Verify the Destination Balance

After the bridge or same-chain swap completes, poll for the asset
arrival on X Layer before returning to the EIP-3009 signing step. The
loop tolerates transient RPC failures and validates that the returned
balance is a non-negative integer.

If after 10 minutes the wallet still has insufficient `$X402_ASSET`,
the funds may have arrived at a different token address (rare for
current Across paths to X Layer) or the bridge may have failed.
Surface the ambiguity to the user with the source-chain tx hash and
the Across explorer link, and ask them to verify on-chain. v1.0.0
does not auto-detect alternate-token arrival on X Layer.

```bash
set -euo pipefail

# Assert prerequisites are set. SOURCE_TX_HASH must have been captured
# from the /swap response before entering the polling loop.

: "${X402_AMOUNT:?missing}"
